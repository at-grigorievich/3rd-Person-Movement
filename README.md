# 3rd-Person-Movement
Idle like 3rd person movement logic in Unity.

By default, the system uses the NavMesh system for character movement.

To implement your own movement system, you must:
1) Inherit your implementation from an abstract MonoBehaviour class `MovableService`
2) Replace the service in the character prefab with your implementation and update the links in the installer
